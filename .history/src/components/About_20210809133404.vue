			Hello, my name is <span>Tomáš</span> and i am 21 years old. I'm currently
			studying fire protection 👨‍🚒 at technical University in Zvolen. I know it's
			little bit strange but one day I saw video on youtube about coding and
			that change my life. I'm started to learn and it became more serious after
			I take my first <a href=""> course</a>in Udemy on Javascript. After that I
			take a course to learn css prepocessor <a href="scss"></a> and javascript
			framework<a href="">vue.js</a> and I also purchase course about
			<a href="">THREE.JS</a>which I did not finish yet.
